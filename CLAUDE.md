# Agent entrypoint

Start here: `AGENTS.md`

Then read (in order):
- `WORKFLOW.md`
- `ISSUES_WORKFLOW.md`

For backend work, also read:
- `backend/AGENTS.md`
- `backend/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `backend/docs/PATTERNS.md`
- `backend/docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`

For frontend work, also read:
- `frontend/AGENTS.md`
- `frontend/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `frontend/docs/PATTERNS.md`
- `frontend/docs/REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`

Rule: use GitHub issues as the default unit of work; quick-fix fast lane is allowed only under `ISSUES_WORKFLOW.md` criteria.
